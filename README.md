# Movie Lens Pandas Demo
A short demo about using pandas to analyze the movie lens moving rating dataset.

The first example is "Human Readable Database Merge Example.ipynb" which illustrates using pandas to load in the simple excel spreadsheets in the "human_readable_spreadsheet_example" folder. It also illustrates merging those spreadsheets into a single unified database.

The second example is "MovieLens.ipynb" which illustrates loading in the Movie Lens 100k dataset, and using various pandas data manipulation tools to calculate the top 5% most beloved movies by scientists according to that data.
